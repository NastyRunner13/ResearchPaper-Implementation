## Overview
This repository contains PyTorch implementations of research papers across various domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Each implementation focuses on:

- Ensuring reproducibility of results.
- Providing clean and modular code for easy understanding.
- Adding detailed documentation and comments for educational purposes.

The primary goal of this repository is to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application.

## Implemented Papers

1. **Transformers for NLP**
   - Paper: "Attention Is All You Need."
   - Implementation of the transformer model for natural language processing tasks.

Additional implementations will be added regularly. Stay tuned!

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (compatible with your system)
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NastyRunner13/ResearchPaper-Implementation.git
   cd ResearchPaper-Implementation
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### Running an Implementation
Each implementation is contained in its respective folder. To run a specific implementation:

1. Navigate to the implementation directory:
   ```bash
   cd transformers_nlp
   ```

2. Run the training or evaluation script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Outputs such as logs, models, and visualizations will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.

### Customizing Hyperparameters
Modify the `config.py` file in each implementation folder to adjust model parameters, learning rates, dataset paths, and other settings.

### Datasets
Ensure the required datasets are downloaded and placed in the appropriate directories as specified in the `README.md` files of individual implementations.
